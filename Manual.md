# Welcome to the ComboCode User Manual
## Introduction
### What is this manual?
- Manual gives instructions on running ComboCode
- Includes some cookbooks for extracting information from ComboCode and using the additional modules
- The difference with the extensive documentation that comes with ComboCode.
Up-to-date documentation that goes with the package is available on GitHub at:

## Goals of the ComboCode package
ComboCode is a Python based package designed to work with radiative-transfer codes and the data they are meant to model. 
The radiative transfer is usually calculated for cool stellar winds of evolved stars, such as AGB stars.
The functionality includes:
* <b>Modeling</b>:
    - Currently works with GASTRoNOoM for gas radiative transfer, and with MCMax for dust radiative transfer
    - Allowing output of one code to be used as input for another
    - Automatic line selection based on available data and line listing
    - Databases for modeling output and easy parameter space searches
    - Interaction with a supercomputer clusters built into the databases
    - Statistical analysis for samples and individual sources, and both resolved and unresolved emission lines
* <b>Data</b>: 
    - Management of data files associated with radio data, SEDs and spectroscopic data
    - Fitting routines for resolved emission lines
