# Note that the same molecule can be passed twice, then a model grid will be created
# taking one of the two for one model, and the other for the second model. The gridding is done additively (such as with ':')
## Molecule_name = short hand molecule notation
## NY_LOW = number of levels in ground-state of molecule
## NY_UP = number of levels in first-vibrational state of molecule
## NLINE =" number of (allowed) radiative transitions in molecule 
## N_IMPACT = number of depth points in radius mesh
## N_IMPACT_EXTRA = number of depth points in radius mesh (< N_IMPACT) which specifically will be used properly sample variable mass-loss. In case of constant mass loss, take 0   
## ABUN_MOLEC = abundance at stellar radius, abun will decrease gradually toward abun_molec_rinner at r_inner
## ABUN_MOLEC_RINNER = abundance at r_inner, will decrease gradually to abun_molec_re at rmax_molec
## ABUN_MOLEC_RE =abundance at rmax_molec, abun from willacy and millar is scaled to this value between rmax_molec and r_outer
## RMAX_MOLEC = two grid points for abun between r_star and r_outer, this is the middle 
##            The above 4 parameters are not relevant for water (para+ortho), 12co and 13co, but always include dummy value however!
## ITERA = Number of mline iterations, set to 0 for LTE (SiO has to have 0 here, cuz not enough collision rates available)
## LTE_REQUEST = Run mline in LTE mode
## USE_COLLIS_RADIAT_SWITCH = set to 1 if one wants to use the collision-radiative switching method of Hummer and Voels (1988)
## R_OUTER = outer radius for this molecule in R_STAR, if 0 the standard R_OUTER value is taken from the input list (which could also be "MAMON")
##          Note that for cooling the standard input values are always taken, whereas for mline/sphinx the values listed here are taken. CO should always have 0 here, or the precise fixed value from the standard input!
## ABUNDANCE_FILENAME = IF you want to include a custom abundance profile for this molecule, give the filename here. Always must have a value, but is only used if the next parameter is not zero.
##                if just filename, it is taken from ~/GASTRoNOoM/CustomAbundances, otherwise state the full path. first column radius in cm, second column abundance molecule versus H2 abundance
## ENHANCE_ABUNDANCE_FACTOR = scale the explicit abundance profile from a file with this factor. Put to 1 for no extra scaling. Put to 0 if you do not want to use a file for the abundance
##                These two parameters are ignored for isotopologues and para water, as the abundances for these are determined from the main isotopologue and the scaling factors (OPR, RATIO_12C_TO_13C, RATIO_16O_TO_17O)
## CHANGE_FRACTION_FILENAME = the filename for the filename below, only relevant if nonzero, but must be included (fraction values with which the values from
##                           cooling are multiplied to be then used in mline and sphinx, units are [cm, unitless fraction values])
## SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_ABUNDANCE = 0 or 1 - change the abundance after cooling (in samling.f and init_mline.f)
## NEW_TEMPERATURE_FILENAME = the filename for the keyword below, only relevant if nonzero, but must be included (filename with other temperature values to be used in mline and sphinx. Units are [cm,K])
## SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_TEMPERATURE = 0 or 1 - change the temperature after cooling (in sampling.f)

#      In case of PACS, use PACS-H2O for water lines, use PACS for all other lines
